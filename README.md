## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

This is the initial release. It identifies and colors keywords, identifiers,
operators, strings, literals and comments. The pipe operator `|` is identified
as `punctuation.pipe.jq`; you can add that to your color theme to give it a
distinct color.

### 0.0.2

A couple of bug fixes:
- Allow underscore in variable names (thanks https://github.com/RossHammer)
- Add the elif keyword (thanks https://github.com/connesc)
